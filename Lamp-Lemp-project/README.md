# Web stack implementation ( lemp stack)
This comprehensive project takes us through a hands-on adventure, harnessing the power of Linux, Nginx, MySQL and PHp to create a dynamic high performance websites.
- Linux provides a solid foundation.
- Nginx serves as a powerful web-server.
- MySQL handles the databases
- PHP empowers server-side funtionality.

### SSH
ssh enables us connect to our CLI agent. (git)

## STEP 1
### nginx

nginx installation web server. To enable us display web pages to our visitors.

![nginx](./img/2.%20install-nginx.png)


### status

![status-check](./img/3.%20status.png)

### Nginx is working

After installation, we checed the status to be sure its working in our CLI and our browser.

## STEP 2
### Installing MySQL

Installing MySQL because after installing a web server we need a database to be able to store and manage data for our site in a relational database.

### Sudo MySQL

### Exit from MySQL

### Secure installation

### Nginx enabled

## STEP 3
### installing PHP

Install PHP to process code and generate dynamic content for the web server.

## STEP 4
### Configuring Nginx to use PHP processor.

when using Nginx web server, we can create server blocks to encapusulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server.

## STEP 5
### Testing PHP with nginx

At this point, our LEMP stack is fully working.Also my LAMP stack is fully operational. So we are testing to be sure that Nginx can correctly hand .php files off our PHP processor.
