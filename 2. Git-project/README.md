## Git project implementation
Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System.

# Let me reak it down in bits...
- Control System: This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides.
- Version Control System: The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.
Distributed Version Control System: Git 
- Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

# Initializing a Repository and making commits.

# Mkdir, cd, git init command

The mkdir command creates a directory, cd command allows you change directory from one to another, and git init command creates an empty git repository.

# Making my first Commit
- # touch, git add, git commit

The touch command creates a file, git add command adds your changes to git staging area, and git commit command commits your changes to git.

# working with branches
Git branch helps you create different copies of your source code.

# git branch

git branch tells you the number of branches available in your working terminal.

The git checkout command allows you to change into an existing or old branch.

# Git merge command

The git merge command allows you to merge one branch to another. Merging every change made to brand A to branch B.

The git branch -d <branch name> allows you delete the branch you dont need anymore.
